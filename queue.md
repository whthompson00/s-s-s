# Wonderful Queue

## Questions

10.1. Within an array, it will be much faster to find a specific index in the array than in an link list because the program would have to traverse many elements of the linked list to find a specific element in a linked list.

10.2. One issue with arrays is that they are a specific size.  So if the programmer allocates more size than elements in the array, then memory is being wasted.  But if the programmer needs to add more elements to the array then the array has space, then the programmer has to move all the elements to a new array which is incredibly inefficient.  A linked list has no defined size so it avoids both these issues.

10.3. The program takes much less time to write.

10.4. The programmer has more control over the design of the queue; so depending on how they want to use the queue, the implementation in c will run faster.

10.5. enqueue: q.append(s) dequeue: q.remove(s)

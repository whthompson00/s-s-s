## Questions

1.1. 10000011

1.2. 11111101

1.3. The value of a counter could become negetive if Google had not used a big enough data structure, like a signed int, which only has 32 bits, to represent view counts.  If the views became greater than 2,147,483,647, or 31 bits in binary, the number of views would "overflow" and become negetive.

1.4. Overflow.c began to print a negetive number after awhile because the integer became bigger than 2,147,483,647, the largest number represented by 31 bits in binary.  The number then becomes a very large negetive.  When the program tries to multiply that by 2, the computer recognizes the bug and sets the value equal to 0.

1.5. The rocket used the software from an old rocket which used a 16 bit integer to store its velocity.  But because this new rocket accelerated faster, the velocity exceeded 32,767, the largest number represented by 16 bits, causing the velocity to become negetive and calculations to go haywire.

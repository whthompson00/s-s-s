# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

For this project, I am think of creating some sort of dynamic website relating to sports analytics.  One direction I could take this project
would be to create a fantasy football platform with more advanced statistics, prediction, and better graphics than ESPN.  We could also
build out a digital app for the site too.  Another idea would be to create a website with the win percentages of each
football, baseball, and basketball game using the GLICKO model rather than ELO.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I plan to collaborate with Reid Piercy whose section leader is Alex Mariona.


## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not at the moment.

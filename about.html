        </header>
        <p>
            Despite being born and raised in the Virginia suburbs of DC, I am a huge fan of the Boston Red Sox, the Pittsburgh Steelers,
            and Lebron James.  In highschool, I played, albeit poorly, golf, baseball, and basketball.  I also like to play less mainstream
            sports including ping pong, surfing, and cycling.

            I love listening to all types of music.  Among my favorite genres are pop, country, reggaeton, and older music.
            My favorite artists are The Beatles, Florida Georgia Line, and Maroon 5.  I also think Il Divo is very underrated.

            In highschool, my favorite classes included Latin, chemistry, and, of course, CS.  In addition to sports and studies,
            I also participated in Public Forum debate for all 4 year--you can read more about that on my debate page.

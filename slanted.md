## Questions

7.1. A cypher is secured if it cannot easily be broken an automated process.

7.2. The caesar cipher is not very secure because some code could easily translate the message 26 different ways.  An intellegent program could then check if any of the outputs match English.

7.3. The slant cipher is not very secure because code could easily reverse engineer the slant for various depths and see if the outputs match real English.

7.4. If you slant a message of length n at depth n, the cipher will just return the message which makes it completely unsecured.

7.5. Hashing takes a string and breaks it into a obscure series of bits such that even small variances in strings will have massive different results.  Hence, hashing is nearly impossible to reverse engineer and cannot be broken unlike encryption.

7.6. See `slanted.py`.

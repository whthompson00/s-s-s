# Memes

## Questions

5.1. The three SQL columns would be the user, the content of the comment, and to what post/comment, if any, the user was replying.

5.2. When displaying the original post, Facebook looks through the whole third column in the database to check if any other posts reply to the main post.  If there are reply posts, then Facebook posts those as well and recursively checks if there are replies to that.

5.3. See `memes.html`.

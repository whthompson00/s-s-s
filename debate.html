            <h1> Debate </h1>

        <p>
            Throughout all four years of high school, I participated in Public Forum, a debate event in which teams of two
            argue for and against a current events topic which changes monthly.  Debate really had a huge impact on my life
            as a thinker and as a person.  As such, I am passionate about helping underserved students grow their debating
            skills.  This past year, I assisted debaters in the Dominican Republic with research and helps develop their persuasive skills.

            In the 2016 debate season, I won the Georgetown University Public Forum Debate Tournament going
            a perfect 10-0 during the debates. At the tournament, I advocated for and against a carbon tax.
            I repeated that result in the 2017 season, becoming the first debater to win the tournament in consecutive years.
            I also finished in the top 30 at the national debate championship in back to back years.  These are my only claim to fame in life.
